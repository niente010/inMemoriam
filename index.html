      <p>This page is dedicated to Marina D'Orio, who passed away at the early age of 26. <br>
        It was created by her friends so that her story and the love she felt for her research could continue to resonate, even posthumously.<br>
        Marina was born in Syracuse in 1991 and lived most of her life in Catania, where she began her university studies. 
        Her parents live in Cassibile, on the slopes of the Iblei Mountains. Not far, her father Michele works in the Syracuse Petrochemical Complex.<br>
        Marina was fascinated by the culture, mythology and history of her homeland, Sicily. Even as a teen, she was still sitting on Uncle’s Lucia lap to hear local stories and tales.
        Moving to study in University of Catania, we became close to the Freaknet Media Lab, where she met XXX and began a journey of sound research that would accompany her until her untimely death.<br>
        Marina was an improvised and amateur researcher. She had no academic training and was not looking for any. Her priority was to take her recorder and walk through the olive groves and mountains, especially at night, to hunt for sounds with her friends XXX and YYY. 
        Then she would return home, cut up the recordings to isolate the sounds of the animals and try to recognise them. She has always listened to so many of them all the time, especially when she left her bedroom window open in the summer and the activity of the fauna kept her company as she tried to fall asleep.
        After collecting a considerable amount of recordings, Marina started to combine them, eventually creating her first compositions. She told us she wanted to recreate the dynamism and vitality she found in nature to see if she could do it too.<br>
        After all, she was an animal too, she said.<br>
        With her modest tools, she began uploading her compositions to the internet with the help of her friends in the city. 
        She was terrified that her recordings would end up in a fire, as had happened to their first home, so she saw virtual space as a safe place to store what she cared about most.<br>
        In September 2006, she was in XXX and while listening with her equipment at dawn in the Iblei mountains, she heard the sound of an animal she had never heard before. 
        The sound was sharp, abrasive and incredibly loud, so much so that Marina began to look around with her torch.
        This had never happened to her before. Sound textures from her land had always calmed her. She took her torch and began to search frantically around her, as the animal seemed to be very close. She encounters a fairly large silhouette, a quadruped with a very noticeable hump, which, although already running away, probably frightened by her reaction, turns towards her.
        The light illuminates its face, and a point of light is reflected in the centre of it.<br>
        Marina told us that her heart had never beaten so fast. She was afraid, but at the same time she had felt tremendously attracted to that animal. As if it was calling her. We’re telling you because she told us countless times.<br>
        It had the outline of a fox, but not the kind that runs through bushes. Its fur was white, shimmering like silver in the moonlight, and then, the light. 
        What seemed a trick of reflection became an eye, wide and glistening, beautiful in its fear. 
        Marina met that eye for a single breath. Then the creature slipped away into the olive trees, vanishing as though it had never been, leaving only one strange detail of having three legs: two in the front, and one in the back with a big claw in it.<br>
        When Marina told us, we laughed, or doubted, or asked so many questions that the story nearly vanished. But she was already lost in wonder. 
        She carried it like a lantern inside her: a hunger to know this creature, to follow it deeper into its mystery, perhaps even to belong to its world.
        This website is the documentation of her research. A record of glimpses, wanderings, and discoveries. <br>
        Either as a fool, as a priestess, an enlightened or a freak, we just want to remember Marina as someone who found something. Something to believe. A creature, a purpose, a spirit. Something that most of us are even incapable to imagine. 
        We love you, Marina.
